# **Section 2: Initial Observations**

This section summarizes **noteworthy findings** directly observable in the patient’s notes, labs, or clinical presentation. It does **not yet interpret or conclude**, but sets the stage for differential diagnosis.

### **Subsections & Content**

1. **Clinical Presentation (Subjective Symptoms)**

   * Key symptoms described by the patient.
   * Examples: fatigue, jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain (especially right upper quadrant), nausea, vomiting, anorexia.
   * Timeline of symptom development (gradual vs sudden onset).

2. **Physical Examination (Objective Signs)**

   * Findings from the doctor’s exam.
   * Examples: hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, edema, skin changes (spider angiomas, palmar erythema).
   * General appearance (ill, cachectic, stable).

3. **Laboratory Findings (if available)**

   * Liver function tests (LFTs): ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin.
   * Coagulation tests (INR, PT) → may indicate impaired synthetic function.
   * Complete blood count (CBC): anemia, leukocytosis.
   * Other relevant labs: renal function (to rule out multi-organ impact).

4. **Imaging Findings (if mentioned)**

   * Ultrasound, CT, MRI → hepatomegaly, steatosis, biliary obstruction.
   * Not always present in first encounter, but relevant if available.

5. **Medication Timing & Exposure Notes**

   * Correlation between medication initiation/change and symptom onset.
   * High-risk drugs flagged for further analysis.

6. **Other Notable Observations**

   * Any unexpected findings not directly liver-related but potentially relevant (e.g., rash, fever, systemic signs).
   * Lifestyle notes (alcohol intake, toxin exposure, herbal supplement use).
