# **Section 6: Consensus (Post-Debate)**

This section consolidates the debate by comparing the **individual agent assessments**, highlighting areas of agreement/disagreement, and concluding with a **final agreed-upon risk level** supported by a balanced rationale.

---

### **6.1 Elements of Consensus**

1. **Summary of Agent Agreement/Disagreement**

   * Highlight whether agents agreed on diagnosis and risk level.
   * If disagreements exist, briefly state the key differences.

2. **Final Consensus Risk Level**

   * Chosen among **None / Low / Medium / High**.
   * May align with majority or strongest evidence.

3. **Consolidated Reasoning**

   * Synthesizes supporting and counter-arguments.
   * Ensures the final decision reflects both caution and confidence.

4. **Uncertainties and Data Gaps** (optional but valuable)

   * Note if further testing or information is required.
   * Example: “Imaging and viral serologies are needed to definitively rule out other causes.”

### **6.2 Example (Filled Out)**

**Summary of Agent Perspectives:**

* Agent A assessed **High** risk, attributing findings directly to methotrexate-induced liver injury.
* Agent B assessed **Medium** risk, noting comorbid anemia may complicate interpretation.
* Agent C assessed **Medium** risk, citing lack of viral hepatitis/imaging data.

**Final Consensus Risk Level:** **High**

**Consolidated Reasoning:**

* All agents agree that significant liver injury is present (clinical jaundice + elevated LFTs).
* Methotrexate use strongly correlates with symptom onset and pattern of hepatocellular injury.
* Although additional testing is warranted, the strength of temporal association and absence of alternative strong explanations support a **High risk of drug-induced liver injury**.

**Uncertainties / Data Gaps:**

* Viral hepatitis serologies and liver ultrasound would provide stronger exclusion of other causes.
* Recommend close monitoring of liver enzymes and consideration of methotrexate discontinuation.
