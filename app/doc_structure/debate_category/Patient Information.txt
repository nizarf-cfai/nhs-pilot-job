# **Section 1: Patient Information**

This section provides the **foundational context** for interpreting the case. It captures demographic details, encounter metadata, medical history, and medication exposure — all of which are critical for assessing possible liver injury.

### **Subsections & Content**

1. **Patient Identifiers**

   * **Patient ID / MRN**: A unique identifier (avoid using real names for privacy).
   * **Name (if allowed)**: Can be anonymized or initials.

2. **Demographics**

   * **Age**: Age is essential since susceptibility to liver injury varies by age group (children, elderly).
   * **Sex/Gender**: Some liver conditions are sex-specific (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis more common in women).
   * **Ethnicity (if available)**: Certain genetic backgrounds may influence susceptibility to DILI (e.g., HLA-linked risk).

3. **Encounter Details**

   * **Date of Encounter(s)**: Timeline is crucial for associating symptoms with drug exposures.
   * **Type of Encounter**: Inpatient, outpatient, ER visit, follow-up, etc.
   * **Location**: Hospital/clinic setting.

4. **Relevant Medical History**

   * **Liver-related history**: Hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcohol use disorder, etc.
   * **Comorbid conditions**: Diabetes, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disease, cancer, etc.
   * **Surgical history**: Especially GI or hepatic surgeries.

5. **Current and Past Medications**

   * **Prescription drugs**: Especially known hepatotoxic drugs (methotrexate, isoniazid, acetaminophen overdose, etc.).
   * **Over-the-counter drugs & supplements**: Herbal remedies, vitamins, alcohol use — often overlooked but important.
   * **Dosage & Duration**: Helps assess whether the drug exposure aligns with symptom onset.

6. **Allergies & Adverse Drug Reactions**

   * Known drug allergies.
   * Previous adverse events, particularly hepatic-related.

7. **Reported Symptoms (subjective)**

   * Patient’s own description: fatigue, jaundice, nausea, abdominal pain, etc.
   * Onset and progression timeline.

8. **Vital Signs (objective, if documented)**

   * Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation.
   * Helps rule out systemic infections or other causes.
