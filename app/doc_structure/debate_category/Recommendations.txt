# **Section 7: Recommendations**

This section provides **evidence-based guidance** on how to proceed, based on the assessed risk of liver injury. Recommendations are tailored to the patient’s context, but structured to ensure consistency across analyses.

### **7.1 Components of Recommendations**

1. **Further Diagnostic Testing**

   * **Laboratory:** Repeat or expand liver panel (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, INR), viral hepatitis serologies, autoimmune markers.
   * **Imaging:** Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to rule out obstruction, fatty liver, or structural abnormalities.
   * **Other:** Metabolic/genetic tests if rare disorders suspected (Wilson’s, hemochromatosis).

2. **Medication Management**

   * **Immediate Actions:**

     * Discontinue suspected hepatotoxic medication if risk is **High** or **Medium-High**.
     * Substitute with safer alternatives if clinically feasible.
   * **Monitoring:**

     * If risk is **Low**, continue medication but monitor liver function closely.

3. **Monitoring & Follow-up**

   * Serial LFT monitoring (e.g., weekly or biweekly until stable).
   * Clinical monitoring for worsening jaundice, encephalopathy, ascites.
   * Escalate care if signs of **acute liver failure** appear.

4. **Specialist Referral**

   * Refer to hepatology if injury is **moderate to severe** or unclear in etiology.
   * Consider multidisciplinary discussion if patient has complex comorbidities.

5. **Patient Counseling**

   * Educate patient on warning symptoms: worsening jaundice, confusion, dark urine, abdominal swelling.
   * Discuss risks and benefits of continuing vs stopping implicated drug.
   * Advise avoidance of alcohol, hepatotoxic over-the-counter meds, and herbal supplements.

### **7.2 Example (Filled Out)**

**Further Diagnostic Testing:**

* Order hepatitis B and C serologies.
* Schedule liver ultrasound to rule out obstruction or fatty infiltration.
* Monitor ALT/AST, bilirubin, and INR weekly.

**Medication Management:**

* Discontinue methotrexate immediately due to high suspicion of DILI.
* Consider alternative DMARD for rheumatoid arthritis.

**Monitoring & Follow-up:**

* Arrange follow-up in 1 week for labs and clinical exam.
* If bilirubin >5 mg/dL or INR >1.5, consider hospitalization.

**Specialist Referral:**

* Refer to hepatology for further evaluation and management.

**Patient Counseling:**

* Advise patient to report worsening jaundice, confusion, or severe abdominal pain.
* Avoid alcohol and herbal remedies until liver function normalizes.
