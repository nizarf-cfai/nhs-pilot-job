# **Section 4: Risk Stratification**

This section provides a **final classification of risk** (None / Low / Medium / High) for liver injury in the patient, supported by explicit reasoning.

---

### **4.1 Risk Levels & Criteria**

1. **Risk Level: None**

   * No clinical, laboratory, or imaging evidence of liver injury.
   * No hepatotoxic medications or relevant exposures.
   * Symptoms are explained by other conditions.

2. **Risk Level: Low**

   * Mild, nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fatigue) without clear hepatic involvement.
   * Medications with low/no hepatotoxic potential.
   * Normal or minimally abnormal liver labs.

3. **Risk Level: Medium**

   * Some evidence suggestive of liver involvement (e.g., mild jaundice, ALT/AST moderately elevated).
   * Possible temporal link with hepatotoxic drug, but alternative explanations exist.
   * No signs of severe or acute liver failure.

4. **Risk Level: High**

   * Strong evidence of liver injury (markedly abnormal LFTs, significant jaundice, coagulopathy).
   * Clear temporal association with hepatotoxic drug or toxin.
   * Alternative explanations ruled out or less likely.
   * Clinical signs of acute or worsening hepatic dysfunction.

### **4.2 Reasoning Framework**

For each patient case, the reasoning should explicitly cover:

* **Clinical Evidence**: Symptoms and physical signs suggestive of liver disease.
* **Laboratory Evidence**: ALT/AST levels (hepatocellular injury), ALP (cholestatic injury), bilirubin, INR.
* **Drug Association**: Timing, dose, known risk profile of medication(s).
* **Exclusion of Alternatives**: Viral, alcohol, metabolic, autoimmune causes.
* **Progression / Severity**: Stable vs worsening presentation.

### **4.3 Example (Filled Out)**

**Risk Level:** **High**

**Reasoning:**

* Patient presents with jaundice, fatigue, and right upper quadrant discomfort.
* Lab results show markedly elevated ALT (520 U/L), AST (410 U/L), and bilirubin (3.2 mg/dL), consistent with hepatocellular injury.
* Methotrexate use initiated 3 months prior strongly correlates with symptom onset.
* No evidence of viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or underlying cirrhosis.
* Other comorbidities (chronic anemia) unlikely to explain hepatic findings.
* Conclusion: Strong likelihood of **drug-induced liver injury (methotrexate-related)**.
