# **Section 5: Agent Perspectives (for Debate Mode)**

This section records the **independent analyses of different reasoning agents**. Each agent reviews the same patient data but may highlight different evidence, weigh risks differently, or prioritize alternate causes. The diversity of perspectives strengthens the debate.

### **5.1 Structure per Agent**

For consistency, each agent’s analysis should include:

1. **Summary Statement**

   * Agent’s general impression of the case.

2. **Evidence Considered**

   * Key clinical signs, labs, imaging, and medication exposures.
   * Explicitly list supporting vs conflicting evidence.

3. **Differential Diagnosis Emphasis**

   * Which causes the agent prioritizes (drug-induced, underlying disease, comorbidities).

4. **Risk Assessment**

   * Assign a preliminary **risk level (None / Low / Medium / High)**.
   * Provide reasoning for that risk level.

### **5.2 Example (3 Agents)**

**Agent A Analysis:**

* **Summary Statement:** Strong suspicion for drug-induced liver injury.
* **Evidence Considered:** Jaundice, elevated ALT/AST, bilirubin elevation, methotrexate exposure.
* **Differential Diagnosis:** Methotrexate-induced liver injury most likely; other causes unlikely given negative history.
* **Risk Assessment:** **High** — findings fit classic DILI pattern.

---

**Agent B Analysis:**

* **Summary Statement:** Liver injury present, but etiology uncertain.
* **Evidence Considered:** Elevated liver enzymes and jaundice noted. Methotrexate timing suggests causality, but anemia and comorbid conditions might complicate interpretation.
* **Differential Diagnosis:** Could be multifactorial — methotrexate toxicity vs metabolic liver stress.
* **Risk Assessment:** **Medium** — clear liver involvement, but causality not fully certain.

---

**Agent C Analysis:**

* **Summary Statement:** Caution — insufficient data to fully attribute to drug.
* **Evidence Considered:** Lab abnormalities are significant, but no imaging and no viral hepatitis screen available.
* **Differential Diagnosis:** DILI possible, but undiagnosed NAFLD or viral hepatitis cannot be ruled out.
* **Risk Assessment:** **Medium** — additional testing needed before confirming drug-induced injury.
